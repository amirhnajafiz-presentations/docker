Let's talk about Docker and Containers, what are containers?
why are we using them? what is Docker? How does Docker manage
containers? And how we can create our own containers with Docker?

## What are containers?

Containers are lightweight packages of your application code 
together with dependencies such as specific versions of 
programming language runtimes and libraries required to run 
your software services.

Containers require less system resources than traditional or 
hardware virtual machine environments because they don't 
include operating system images. 
Applications running in containers can be deployed easily 
to multiple different operating systems and hardware platforms.
